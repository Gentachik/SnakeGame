# SnakeGame
This is a simple implementation of the Snake game in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The game features a snake that moves around a grid, eating apples and growing longer. The objective of the game is to control the snake and avoid collision with the walls or its own body.

# How to Play
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Run the S28307Projekt04 class, which contains the main method.
2. Use the arrow keys or W/A/S/D keys to control the snake's movement (up, left, down, right).
3. The snake starts with a head represented by the "@" symbol.
4. Move the snake towards the apples represented by the "*" symbol to eat them.
5. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer.
6. Avoid collision with the walls represented by the "X" symbol or the snake's own body represented by the "#" symbol.
7. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
